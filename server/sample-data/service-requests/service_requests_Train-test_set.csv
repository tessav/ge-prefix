The images on this exam also error out if I try to send them from the other scanner or AW to PACS. I shut the scanner down properly and brought it back up. In Job Management it says Processing failure. Failure Reason from remote host: Unable to store. Try again after some time. It has been almost 2 hours. Is this problem originating with the scanner or do I need to call our PACS help desk? Thank you for your help. Image:7396-NONE-NONE

Then  a half hour later  i went over to the scanner and the green was now a blue. Usually the scanner will be in the yellow zone for at least an hour. It happened while a pediatric patient was on the table and we were getting them set for the scan  and all of a sudden it was blue. So we had to get the patient off the table and out of the room to warm up the scanner. Today  May 15th  I was expecting a stat patient and they were coming in 25minutes. I had 4 minutes left of the green  and right before the patient came in the room 25minutes later  the scanner was back to blue. This should not be getting cold this quickly.  Image:NONE-NONE-NONE

They are exams 1582  1583 yesterday  and 1597 and 1598= today.  In Pacs  it looks like there are 2 exams under the same accession number  each having a different number of images.  Image numbers are random...you might have images 1 3 5 6 9 etc. under one group  and 2 4 7 8 10 11 under the other.  Pacs admin was unable to identify why this is happening  so we thought you might be able to shed some light on it if it happens to be occurring on the scanner  rather than during image transfer to PACS.

I shut the system down and when I finally got it back up I didn't have any more problems. I spoke to someone at GE yesterday and he said he found a batch error on a test patient I did while he was on the phone. He wanted to do something to the system that would erase my patient database. I still had processing to do so I was going to call him back when I was done. Due to the work load and not having the problem again  I didn't call back. The last patient I did  the system didn't create my reformats. Can you help me resolve this? Thanks. Image:NONE-NONE-NONE

It also froze up on me earlier so since then I did a complete shutdown and it still is coming up spread across the 2 display monitors until i shrink it back to normal and move it to the right display.  When clicking on viewer you have to move the imageworks info out of the way to be able to look at what is pulled up on the viewer also.    It is just acting really odd.  Let me know if this can be fixed.  Currently it let me send my images and hasnt froze up on me  but it may do it again.  No issues however when scanning though.

The tube started rotating  however I could not start the actual warmup scans. I restarted the system twice  but the same problems remained. I then shut the entire system down from the breaker. The gantry touch screen came on  but appears to have stopped/frozen in the bootup process. A message popped up on my workstation stating """"The Xray and Drive power is disabled. Please walk into the scan room and press the Reset button on the Gantry Control Panel."""" I pressed the blinking reset button on the gantry. I then attempted to run Tube Warmup again. The messages """"Xray and drive power disabled. Please enable."""" and """"Scanner Hardware Stopped Scan"""" show up under the heading """"Real Time Information. I again pressed the reset button on the gantry. The tube did not start rotating with this warmup attempt. I restarted the systrem from the breaker panel a second time  and had the same results.
